# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName localhost
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule (.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 [R,L]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache2/htdocs

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile conf/extra/localhost.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/extra/localhost.key
    Protocols h2 http/1.1

#    <Location "/">
#        AuthType Basic
#        AuthName "Restricted Area"
#        AuthUserFile "conf/extra/.localhost.htpasswd"
#        Require valid-user
#    </Location>
</VirtualHost>
